This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website is built using **Jekyll**, a simple, blog-aware static site generator, and is hosted for free using **GitHub Pages**.

## Features
- **Creative Portfolio Integration**: Showcase your work in a professional, visually appealing way.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Customizable Themes**: Easily update colors, fonts, and layout to match your personal brand.
- **Blog Functionality**: Share your thoughts, updates, or case studies with a built-in blogging platform.
- **Free Hosting**: Deployed on GitHub Pages for free.

## Demo
You can view the live website at: [MyPortfolioURL](https://leeeeesamo.github.io)

## Customization

- **Configuring the Website**: Update `_config.yml` to personalize your site (e.g., site title, description, and theme settings).
- **Adding Portfolio Items**: Add your projects in the `_posts` directory, following the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. Use Markdown to describe each project and include images.
- **Changing Themes**: Modify the `assets/css` files to customize the appearance.
